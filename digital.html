                  <h1>Hamlet Book Cover Redesign - 2023</h1>
                  <h3>
            Here is a 2D illustration I did in my design fundamentals class in 2023. Keeping the content of the book in mind I decided to use an old english font for the text on the front and back cover along with a serif font for the bodycopy. The back of the book design also features a portion of text that is found on every copy of Macbeth. For the main design on the front cover I made an abstract 2D illustration of a bloody rapier and a crown, to symbolize the duel that takes place in the story. I used Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop for this project.

                  <h3>
            This is a cover I designed for my coneptual image class in 2024. For this project were we each assigned a name for our cover. Mine was "On Purpose". We also took photos of each other and the professor (the hands in the photo) for our covers. With all this in mind I used a blue duotone color palette and zoomed in on the hands and keyboard in the design. I used other blue note jazz covers as inspiration for my design. I used only Adobe Photoshop for this design.

                Here is another 2D mockup I created in my design fundamentals class in 2023. I designed the logo and menu from a coneptual coffee shop name which was "Coffee Dog". I used Adobe Photoshop to create the menu and Illustrator to make the logo.

Here is a movie poster I designed for my conceptual image class in 2024. For this project I was given the task to develop a movie poster using character montage.

              <h1>Oscars Best Actress Magazine Spread - 2024</h1>
              <h3>
This was one of my favorite graphic design projects I have worked on. This is a magazine spread for a conceptual oscars magazine featuring the best actress nominees for the 2024 academy awards ceremony. For the first page I designed a graphic using blown up typegraphy, juxtaposing the individual letters next to each other while trying to maintain legibility. On the right page I have a photo montage of the five oscar nominees for best actress with their names also present above them. I only used photoshop for this design.
